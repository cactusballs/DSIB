      <p class="chooselife">Choose life. Choose not smelling like an ashtray. Choose your skin, choose your hair, choose your teeth, choose to keep your legs. Choose not spending your hard-earned cash on self inflicted cancer. Choose to break free from nicotine addiction and actually afford that holiday you keep telling your mates about. Choose not inflicting second hand smoke on the people you love. Choose not to pollute the seas with your cancerous debris. Choose being smug as fuck when you say you don't have a lighter. Choose your friends, choose your parents, choose your sisters and brother. Choose breathing, choose your lungs, choose your heart. Choose life.</p>
